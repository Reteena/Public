          "text": "Most conventional interventions for patients facing terminal illness or cognitive decline focus on managing physical symptoms, providing palliative care, and offering psychological support through traditional counseling methods. While these approaches address important aspects of patient wellbeing, they often miss what patients and their families actually grieve most deeply during these difficult times. Through extensive conversations with patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers, a profound pattern emerged that fundamentally shaped the development of Remembrance. What people mourn is not simply the loss of life itself, but rather the erosion of shared moments together, the fading of inside jokes that defined relationships, the forgetting of humorous nicknames that carried decades of affection, and the gradual disappearance of the countless small interactions that constitute the texture of human connection. These seemingly minor details represent the lived experience of relationships, the accumulated history that makes each bond unique and irreplaceable."

          "text": "Traditional therapeutic approaches, while valuable, often struggle to address this specific form of grief because they lack mechanisms for actively preserving and engaging with these precious details before they are lost. Standard reminiscence therapy, a well-established intervention particularly for dementia patients, typically relies on physical objects like photo albums, music, or familiar objects to trigger memories and stimulate conversation. While effective, this approach depends heavily on the availability of appropriate prompts and the therapist's skill in facilitating recall. As cognitive decline progresses or as end-of-life approaches, the window for capturing these memories narrows, and the burden on families to document and preserve them becomes overwhelming at precisely the moment when they are least equipped to handle additional responsibilities. The spontaneous, unstructured nature of memory recall also means that important moments may never be captured simply because the right prompt never appeared at the right time."

          "text": "The insight that inspired Remembrance came from recognizing that the moments people cherish most are often not the major life events documented in photo albums or medical records, but rather the small, repeated interactions that build relationship intimacy over time. A particular way someone laughed at a certain type of joke. The nickname that started from a childhood mispronunciation and persisted for fifty years. The story told and retold at every family gathering, with each retelling adding new embellishments and inside references. The ritual of Sunday morning phone calls or the specific way a grandparent said goodnight. These moments are simultaneously deeply meaningful and incredibly vulnerable to loss because they exist primarily in living memory, rarely documented or preserved in any systematic way. When cognitive decline or terminal illness threatens these memories, families face the heartbreaking prospect of losing not just their loved one but the entire shared history that defined their relationship."

          "text": "This realization suggested that therapeutic interventions could be dramatically more effective if they focused explicitly on capturing, preserving, and actively engaging with these specific types of memories before they were lost. Rather than waiting for memories to fade and then trying to stimulate recall, a proactive approach could systematically elicit and document the rich tapestry of shared experiences while patients still retained the capacity to recall and articulate them. Such an approach would serve multiple therapeutic purposes simultaneously. For patients, the process of recalling and sharing these memories provides cognitive stimulation, emotional validation, and a sense of legacy creation, affirming that their experiences and relationships have lasting meaning. For family members, participating in memory capture provides quality time with their loved one focused on positive shared experiences rather than illness management, creates a permanent record they can return to after loss, and helps them process anticipatory grief by actively engaging with rather than avoiding the reality of impending loss."

          "text": "The therapeutic value of reminiscence has been well-established in gerontology and palliative care research, with studies demonstrating benefits including reduced depression and anxiety, improved quality of life, enhanced sense of identity and continuity, and strengthened family bonds. However, traditional reminiscence therapy faces practical limitations that restrict its accessibility and effectiveness. It typically requires trained facilitators, making it expensive and available primarily in institutional settings. Sessions are time-limited and infrequent, providing only brief windows for memory work. The unstructured nature of conversation means important memories may never surface if the right prompts are not provided. Documentation, when it occurs, often consists of simple notes that capture only a fraction of the richness of the conversation. These limitations suggested that technology, thoughtfully applied with respect for the deeply personal nature of the work, could substantially enhance the reach and impact of reminiscence therapy."

The system engages patients in gentle, conversational prompting designed to elicit memories of the small, meaningful moments that define relationships. Rather than asking broad questions that might overwhelm or confuse patients with cognitive impairment, Remembrance uses a carefully designed progression of specific, focused prompts that scaffold memory recall. These prompts are personalized based on information provided by family members during setup, allowing the system to ask about specific people, places, and time periods relevant to the patient's life. The conversational interface is designed to be natural and unintimidating, avoiding technical jargon or complex interactions that might frustrate patients with varying levels of technological literacy or cognitive capacity."

Rather than asking patients to generate memories unprompted, which can be cognitively demanding and frustrating, the system provides specific cues that activate relevant memory networks. For example, instead of asking about a general relationship, Remembrance might prompt with specific contexts like meals shared together, holiday traditions, or particular locations associated with positive memories. When a memory begins to emerge, the system asks follow-up questions that help patients elaborate and enrich their recollections, gently guiding them to include sensory details, emotional responses, and the reactions of others present. This scaffolding approach makes memory work less frustrating and more successful, increasing patient engagement and the richness of captured memories."

The system is programmed to recognize signs of patient fatigue, confusion, or distress and to respond appropriately by simplifying prompts, taking breaks, or shifting to less emotionally charged topics. It validates patient emotions and memories without judgment, accepting whatever patients choose to share without imposing external standards of what should be remembered or how memories should be expressed. For patients who find certain topics difficult or painful, the system respects their boundaries and explores alternative avenues for positive reminiscence. This emotional intelligence, while implemented through carefully designed conversational rules and sentiment analysis, creates an experience that patients and families describe as supportive rather than mechanical."

Practically, family members provide essential context and personalization information that makes prompts relevant and meaningful to patients. They can participate in joint reminiscence sessions where multiple perspectives on shared memories are captured, often leading to richer and more complete narratives as participants fill in details the others had forgotten or provide their own viewpoints on shared experiences. Therapeutically, the process of collaborating on memory work provides structured, meaningful interaction time focused on positive shared history rather than illness management or caregiving tasks. This can help shift family dynamics away from the exclusively caregiver-patient relationship that often dominates late-life care, toward a more balanced relationship where the patient is recognized as a person with a rich history rather than simply a set of care needs."

Human memory is not a filing cabinet where experiences are stored in separate folders, but rather a richly interconnected network where each memory connects to many others through various types of relationships. Remembering one event often triggers recall of related events because they share participants, locations, emotional tones, or thematic elements. A knowledge graph mimics this associative structure by representing memories as nodes with explicit relationships linking them to other memories, people, places, time periods, and emotional themes. This graph structure enables several capabilities that would be impossible or much more difficult with traditional document storage."

Rather than presenting isolated prompts, Remembrance can follow threads of association, asking patients to elaborate on people or places mentioned in one memory by recalling other memories involving those same elements. This associative approach mirrors natural reminiscence in human conversation and makes the experience feel more organic and less interrogative. For family members reviewing captured memories, the graph structure enables exploration through multiple pathways based on their interests or needs at different times. They might explore chronologically to understand life progression, by person to see all memories involving a particular family member or friend, by location to recall a childhood home or favorite vacation spot, or by theme to find all memories involving humor, challenge, or triumph."

If a patient's recollection of a specific event becomes confused or incomplete over time, the connections to related memories, the people involved, and the broader context preserved in the graph help reconstruct a more complete picture. This redundancy mirrors how human memory networks provide resilience against forgetting, where losing access to one memory pathway does not necessarily mean the memory is entirely inaccessible if alternative routes exist. For families using Remembrance over extended periods as cognitive decline progresses, this redundancy becomes increasingly valuable as it allows them to maintain connection to memories even as the patient's ability to actively contribute new recollections diminishes."

When a patient describes a memory, the system identifies key elements such as people mentioned, locations, time indicators, activities, and emotional content. These extracted elements become nodes and edges in the knowledge graph, automatically creating links to existing nodes when the same elements appear in multiple memories. The system also infers additional relationships based on temporal proximity, co-occurrence of participants, and thematic similarity, enriching the graph beyond what is explicitly stated. This automatic structuring happens behind the scenes without requiring patients or families to manually organize or categorize their memories, preserving the natural, conversational character of the reminiscence experience."

All memory data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, with access strictly controlled and limited to authorized family members designated by the patient or their healthcare proxy. The system includes granular privacy controls allowing patients and families to designate certain memories as private if they wish, and to control what can be shared with healthcare providers if integration with care planning is desired. Data is not used for any purpose beyond serving the patient and family, with no mining for commercial purposes or research without explicit consent. The knowledge graph architecture, while computationally sophisticated, is implemented in a way that prioritizes data privacy and user control, recognizing that these memories represent some of the most intimate and precious information people possess."

Our framework demonstrates that with appropriate computational techniques and hardware optimization, low field systems can produce clinically relevant images suitable for a wide range of diagnostic applications.

Excitatory pyramidal neurons exhibit spike-frequency adaptation, where their firing rates progressively decline during sustained input due to the accumulation of calcium-activated potassium currents.

When the membrane potential crosses a fixed threshold, a spike is generated, the neuron briefly enters a refractory period during which it cannot spike again, and the potential is reset to a subthreshold value.

In real neurons, the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels creates a positive feedback process where depolarization leads to more channel opening, which causes further depolarization. This process accelerates as threshold is approached, creating the characteristic sharp onset of action potentials. The exponential term in the AdEx model approximates this nonlinearity, producing more realistic spike shapes and timing compared to the hard threshold of the LIF model. Second, and more importantly for network dynamics, the AdEx model includes an adaptation variable that implements spike-frequency adaptation. This adaptation current is driven by each spike and decays slowly between spikes, effectively implementing a form of negative feedback that reduces the neuron's excitability following periods of high activity."

At the single-neuron level, adaptation causes firing rates to decline over the course of sustained inputs, allowing neurons to differentially respond to transient changes versus sustained features of stimuli. This property is thought to contribute to sensory adaptation phenomena observed psychophysically. At the network level, adaptation in excitatory neurons helps stabilize recurrent circuits by providing negative feedback that counteracts runaway excitation. When many excitatory neurons fire strongly, their collective adaptation accumulates, reducing network excitability and preventing pathological synchronization. The parameters controlling adaptation strength and timescale can be adjusted in CortiForge to match the properties of different neuron types or to explore how adaptation influences network behavior."

By using different neuron models for these populations, we capture key differences in their intrinsic dynamics while keeping both models within the computationally tractable point-neuron framework.

This creates a more realistic input-output relationship where synaptic effects are strongest when the membrane potential is far from the reversal potential and weaken as the potential approaches that reversal value. For excitatory synapses, the reversal potential is set near zero millivolts, well above typical resting potentials, so excitatory inputs drive the membrane potential upward. For inhibitory synapses, the reversal potential is set near the resting potential or slightly below, so inhibitory inputs pull the potential toward or below rest, counteracting excitatory drive. This conductance-based approach captures the shunting effects of inhibition, where inhibitory synapses reduce neuronal excitability not just by hyperpolarizing the membrane but by increasing membrane conductance and thus reducing the impact of excitatory inputs."

The magnitude of these weight changes decays exponentially with the time difference between spikes, implementing a form of temporal credit assignment that strengthens connections responsible for driving postsynaptic firing while weakening ineffective connections. Weight changes are accumulated over many spike pairings, allowing the network to gradually learn the statistical structure of its inputs.

However, comparison with experimental LFP spectra revealed important differences in the distribution of power across frequency bands. The simulation exhibited relatively more power in high-gamma frequencies and less in the delta range compared to experimental recordings. This pattern suggests that while the model captures fast local dynamics mediated by excitatory-inhibitory interactions, it may not fully implement the slower, large-scale network mechanisms responsible for low-frequency oscillations.

The differences in LFP spectral content suggest that additional mechanisms may need to be incorporated, such as adaptation currents with longer timescales, synaptic depression that provides negative feedback on faster timescales than spike-frequency adaptation, or explicit modeling of thalamocortical inputs that can drive low-frequency rhythms.

Current LLM-augmented multi-agent systems tend to produce verbose and redundant outputs that consume substantial computational resources without proportional gains in solution quality. They struggle to explore diverse alternative strategies and potential future states, often settling on the first reasonable solution rather than searching systematically for superior options. Perhaps most critically, existing systems lack robust mechanisms for navigating multi-stakeholder scenarios where different parties hold conflicting objectives and preferences.

Gene duplication followed by subfunctionalization, where copied genes diverge to perform related but distinct functions, suggests mechanisms for creating specialized variants of high-performing strategies. Social decision-making in animal groups, where individuals with different preferences must reach collective decisions, offers insights into fair aggregation of heterogeneous stakeholder preferences. Resource constraints in biological systems, where organisms must balance energy expenditure against fitness gains, motivate compute-aware optimization that rewards efficient solutions.

As the search progresses and promising regions of solution space are identified, plasticity application probability can increase, focusing computational effort on polishing the most promising candidates.

Lark implements an analogous process where high-performing strategies are probabilistically selected for duplication based on their fitness, as measured by aggregated stakeholder preferences.

The compute-adjusted fitness function applies a soft penalty based on the token count of each strategy relative to a target budget, reducing fitness scores for strategies that exceed the target length.

Increasing efficiency metrics indicate that the system is discovering more compact ways to express effective strategies, a desirable outcome that reduces deployment costs and inference latency.

Multi-stakeholder strategy generation fundamentally differs from typical reinforcement learning scenarios because it lacks the sequential state-action structure that RL methods are designed to exploit. Strategies are generated holistically and evaluated in their entirety rather than constructed through sequences of incremental decisions that can be individually credited or blamed. The sparse and ordinal nature of stakeholder feedback, provided as rankings rather than detailed error signals, makes gradient-based policy updates problematic. Evolutionary approaches handle these challenges naturally by treating each strategy as an atomic unit subject to selection and variation, without requiring decomposition into sequential decisions or continuous reward signals."

Previous work has shown that LLM-driven evolutionary search can outperform reinforcement learning in domains like algorithm discovery, where the goal is to find effective procedures rather than to learn sequential policies.

In biological systems, genes do not function in isolation but rather participate in complex regulatory networks, signaling pathways, and protein interaction cascades. The expression level of any single gene must be interpreted in the context of its network neighbors, upstream regulators, and downstream targets.

In biological terms, different tokens might correspond to different functional modules, regulatory programs, or cellular processes that collectively determine disease state.

The fact that attention-based models substantially outperform feature-based baselines validates this emphasis on contextual relationships."

          "text": "The integration of biological prior knowledge through pathway gates, PPI masks, and stage-aware attention demonstrates a productive middle ground between purely data-driven machine learning and manually engineered feature selection. Pure machine learning approaches treat all gene pairs as equally likely to interact and all genes as equally likely to be relevant, learning relationships purely from correlations in training data. This flexibility is powerful but can lead to overfitting on spurious correlations, especially when training data is limited compared to the hypothesis space. Manual feature engineering, where domain experts select specific genes or pathways to include based on prior biological knowledge, avoids spurious correlations but may miss novel patterns and cannot adapt to new data. GeneAttentionNet's hybrid approach allows the model to discover patterns in data while being guided by biological constraints that make implausible relationships unlikely and encourage attention to known regulatory connections."

          "text": "The interpretability advantages provided by structured attention and biological priors extend beyond simply explaining model predictions to enabling hypothesis generation about disease mechanisms. By examining which attention weights are largest for correctly classified Alzheimer's samples, researchers can identify specific gene-gene relationships that appear particularly diagnostic. When these relationships correspond to known protein-protein interactions enforced by the PPI mask, they suggest that the physical interaction between those proteins plays a role in disease pathology. When pathway gates consistently assign high weights to particular biological pathways, it indicates that dysregulation of those pathways is a common feature across Alzheimer's patients. These mechanistic insights would be difficult or impossible to extract from black-box classifiers that achieve high accuracy without providing interpretable intermediate representations."

          "text": "The substantial performance gap between GeneAttentionNet and simpler baselines highlights the importance of inductive biases that match the structure of the problem domain. The MLP baseline, despite having millions of parameters and the ability to approximate any function given sufficient data, achieves significantly worse training accuracy than GeneAttentionNet. This is not because MLPs are fundamentally incapable of learning the relevant patterns but rather because the space of possible functions they could learn is so vast that finding the right function from limited training data becomes extremely difficult. GeneAttentionNet narrows this search space through architectural constraints that embody assumptions about how gene expression data should be processed: that genes should be considered in groups or contexts rather than individually, that known regulatory relationships should be emphasized, that pathway-level organization matters. These constraints, far from limiting model capacity in problematic ways, actually improve learning by focusing capacity on biologically plausible hypotheses."

          "text": "The challenges revealed by validation curve analysis, particularly the evidence of overfitting in later training epochs, point to important directions for future work. The dataset size of 1247 samples, while substantial for gene expression studies, remains modest by deep learning standards where millions of training examples are common. Several approaches could address this limitation and potentially improve generalization. Data augmentation techniques adapted to gene expression, such as adding small amounts of noise to simulate biological and technical variation, might effectively increase training set size. Transfer learning from related tasks, such as classification of other neurodegenerative diseases or prediction of disease-relevant molecular phenotypes, could provide useful initializations that reduce the amount of Alzheimer-specific training data needed. More sophisticated regularization schemes, such as pathway-level dropout that temporarily removes entire biological processes rather than individual neurons, might better match the structure of the problem and prevent overfitting more effectively than standard dropout."
